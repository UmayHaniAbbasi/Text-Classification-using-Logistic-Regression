# Text-Classification-using-Logistic-Regression
implementation of a text classification task focused on hallucination detection using Logistic Regression. The objective is to build a binary classifier that identifies whether a given text (summary) is hallucinated or not, using the XSum Hallucination dataset.


The project includes:

Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the text data for model input.

Logistic Regression Model Implementation: Implementing the logistic regression algorithm manually, without using any machine learning libraries.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, alongside a confusion matrix for better visualization.

Cross-Validation: Implementing k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's robustness.

Error Analysis: Analyzing misclassified examples and proposing potential improvements.

The repository contains:

Jupyter notebook 

Code for preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation

Visualizations of model performance and analysis
